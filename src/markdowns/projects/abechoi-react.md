## Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my very first website, I developed and deployed on my own, with React Hooks and AWS Amplify. Looking back, I don't understand why I made the decisions I did, but I would assume it was due to lack of experience.

## Challenges

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember being troubled with react-router-dom at the time, as it took me a while to wrap my head around it. This was my biggest challenge at the time, no doubt. Now, I just need to look at some examples, to jog my memory, and I shouldn't have any issues.

## Takeaways

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing this website was crucial for my growth. It gave me the confidence to not only start ambitious projects, but to actually finish, which is a very different animal.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I finished my first React project, I started to delve into MERN and PERN stacks, and eventually moved into Gatsby and Next. I had some frustrating moments, but overcoming those moments pushed me forward, and redefined and expanded, my own personal limitations.
