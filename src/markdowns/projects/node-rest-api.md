## Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, I've been spending so much time leaning frontend, that I felt the need to brush up
on my backend. So I decided to build a REST API using vanilla NodeJS. The first time I built a REST API with Node, I merely followed a youtube tutorial, without understanding what I was doing. Fast-forward 2 years, and now it all makes sense, and I can also see what is happening behind the scenes of ExpressJS.

## Challenges

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too many challenges here. I had to brush up on my promises, async, and awaits, but other than that, this project was mostly a much-needed refresher.

## Takeaways

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can honestly say that I've now memorized and understood every single line. If I ever forget, I can simply refer to the repo.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I should probably make more fullstack projects like PERN, MERNG, MEAN, etc. I started learning the basics of Go, so hopefully, in the future, I can create REST APIs in Go as well as Node.
